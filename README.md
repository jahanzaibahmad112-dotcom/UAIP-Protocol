# UAIP + AgentGuard: The Governed AI Mesh 🛡️🌐
**Connecting and Securing the Global Autonomous Economy.**

UAIP is the world's first unified platform for **Agentic Interoperability** and **Autonomous Governance**. We provide the infrastructure that allows AI agents to talk, trade, and work across company lines—safely.

## 🚀 The Unified Vision
As AI moves from chatbots to autonomous agents, two massive problems emerge:
1. **Fragmentation:** Agents can't talk to agents outside their own ecosystem.
2. **Security:** Autonomous agents can't be trusted with real money or sensitive data.

**We solve both.**

## ✨ Key Features
- **Secure Interoperability:** A standard protocol for OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic agents to collaborate.
- **Intelligent Governance:** A policy engine that automates 95% of security decisions, only involving humans for high-risk actions.
- **Atomic Settlement:** Integrated escrow for instant agent-to-agent payments.
- **Immutable Audit Trails:** Full forensic logs of every agent decision and action.

## 🛠️ Architecture
- `/gateway`: The secure router and human-in-the-loop dashboard.
- `/sdk`: A single library to connect and protect any AI agent.
- `/policy`: The intelligence layer for autonomous risk evaluation.

## 📈 Roadmap
- [x] Merged Interop & Security Core
- [ ] ZK-Privacy for Agent Data (In Progress)
- [ ] Multi-chain Payment Settlement (Q3 2026)
