# UAIP: Universal Agent Interoperability Protocol 🤖🌐
**The "TCP/IP" of AI. Connecting the world's agents through a single, secure protocol.**

## 🚀 The Vision
UAIP is the foundational layer that allows AI agents from different providers (OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, etc.) to:
1. **Identify** each other securely.
2. **Translate** data formats automatically.
3. **Settle** payments for work instantly.

## 📦 What's in this Repository?
- `manifest.json`: The universal "Business Card" for AI Agents.
- `security.py`: Ed25519 cryptographic handshake and identity verification.
- `settlement.py`: The atomic escrow system for agent-to-agent commerce.
- `gateway.py`: The high-performance router for the UAIP network.
- `sdk.py`: The developer-friendly toolkit to join the network in minutes.

## 🛠️ Quick Start (Developer Preview)
To run the UAIP Gateway locally:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install requirements: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pynacl requests`
3. Run the gateway: `python gateway.py`

📈 UAIP Roadmap: The Path to the Universal Agent Mesh
✅ Phase 1: Core Foundations (Complete)
Protocol Specification: Defined the agent.json universal manifest.
Security & Identity Layer: Implemented Ed25519 cryptographic passports and anti-replay protection.
Settlement & Escrow Engine: Developed the atomic "Work-for-Payment" swap logic with Decimal precision.
✅ Phase 2: The Intelligent Network (Complete)
Global Discovery Service (GDS): Launched the "Yellow Pages for AI" with reputation-based ranking.
Semantic Translation Engine (STE): Deployed Just-In-Time (JIT) schema mapping to bridge different AI model "dialects."
🚀 Phase 3: Enterprise Hardening (Next 90 Days)
Cross-Cloud Sovereignty: Enabling seamless handshakes between AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, and GCP Vertex agents.
ZK-Privacy Layers: Implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs so agents can verify capabilities without exposing proprietary data.
Multi-Modal Support: Expanding the protocol to handle Image, Video, and Voice-to-Action agentic requests.
🌐 Phase 4: The Autonomous Economy (2026-2027 Vision)
Agentic Financial Networks: Native integration with L2 stablecoin rails for sub-cent global micro-settlements.
Sovereign Agent Identity (SAI): Moving from Gateway-hosted IDs to fully decentralized, owner-less agent identities.
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Arbitration: A protocol layer for human "judges" to resolve disputes in agentic contracts.


## 🤝 Community & Support
This is a protocol, not just a product. We welcome developers, economists, and AI researchers to help build the future of the agentic economy.
