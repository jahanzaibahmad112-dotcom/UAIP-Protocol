# UAIP: Universal Agent Interoperability Protocol 🤖🌐
**The "TCP/IP" of AI. Connecting the world's agents through a single, secure protocol.**

## 🚀 The Vision
UAIP is the foundational layer that allows AI agents from different providers (OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, etc.) to:
1. **Identify** each other securely.
2. **Translate** data formats automatically.
3. **Settle** payments for work instantly.

## 📦 What's in this Repository?
- `manifest.json`: The universal "Business Card" for AI Agents.
- `security.py`: Ed25519 cryptographic handshake and identity verification.
- `settlement.py`: The atomic escrow system for agent-to-agent commerce.
- `gateway.py`: The high-performance router for the UAIP network.
- `sdk.py`: The developer-friendly toolkit to join the network in minutes.

## 🛠️ Quick Start (Developer Preview)
To run the UAIP Gateway locally:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install requirements: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pynacl requests`
3. Run the gateway: `python gateway.py`

## 📈 Roadmap
- [x] Protocol Specification
- [x] Security & Identity Layer
- [x] Settlement & Escrow Engine
- [ ] Global Discovery Service (In Development)
- [ ] Semantic Translation Engine (In Development)

## 🤝 Community & Support
This is a protocol, not just a product. We welcome developers, economists, and AI researchers to help build the future of the agentic economy.
