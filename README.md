🛡️ UAIP + AgentGuard

The Secure Settlement & Interoperability Layer for the AI Economy

UAIP (Universal Agent Interoperability Protocol) is the foundational "TCP/IP" layer for the agentic web. Combined with AgentGuard, it provides a military-grade governance and settlement framework that allows AI agents from different ecosystems to identify, communicate, and trade with each other safely.

✨ The 5-Layer Security Stack

🔍 Layer 1: Automated Discovery
Real-time scanning and inventory of all enterprise agents to prevent "Shadow AI."

🔐 Layer 2: Zero-Trust Identity
Every agent possesses a cryptographically verifiable DID Passport verified by math (Ed25519).

⚡ Layer 3: JIT Authorization
Zero Standing Privileges. Power is granted via 60-second Just-In-Time (JIT) tokens.

📊 Layer 4: Forensic Auditing
RAG-powered audit trails using Llama-3-Legal to verify SOC2 and EU AI Act compliance.

💰 Layer 5: Multi-Chain Settlement
Nano-payments ($0.01+) settled via USDC on Base/Solana with an integrated 0.5% protocol tax.
